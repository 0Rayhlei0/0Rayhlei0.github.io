# 序言

用英语用了这么多年，在英语学习上面已经不需要再在乎太多语法发音之类的问题了，因为在我看来那些都已经不会太大影响到英语水平，以实用为标准的话现在学习英语需要提升的主要是欧美的文化习惯和词汇量了。个人认为最好的办法就是认真地在欧美流行的电视剧或电影中学习他们的表达，这样既可以避免学到生僻没用的单词，也可以在一个流畅的语境下学习到新的表达甚至温故知新。

## 学习方法

首先一定要建立认知，看剧不是目的，学英语才是目的。只有在心里认知了这个目的，才能在之后的学习中不会急躁，因为我的方法非常慢但也非常稳。简单来说就是每集剧看3遍：

`第一遍：`无字幕看第一遍，第一遍的目的首先是建立对剧情发展的一个基本认识，另外对哪些部分看不懂的也会有比较清晰的认识，最后这也是建立兴趣的关键一步，因为有了第一遍的“看不懂”的对比，第三遍时“完全看懂”才能提供成就感的反馈，激励自己更长久地学习。

`第二遍：`对着剧的脚本一句话一句话地看剧，记录`不熟悉`或者`能听能看但不会用`的词和表达，我首先会用有道的`Collins词典`查释义(`Collins`的特点是将词放在英语的上下文中解释，非常适合`非母语者`快速了解单词的用法)，如果`Colins`没有收录才去查其他词典或例句。第二遍这个过程是最痛苦的，有时候一个1小时的剧要看4小时才能看完，实在不行就分几天看完，一定不能急躁。 

`第三遍：`最后再无字幕看一遍，这一遍是最爽的了。看完前两遍第三遍时基本上已经无障碍看剧了，看着剧里那些生僻的表达和含糊的口语都在脑海里清晰地形成文本，这时候就会感觉学习真是太爽了。
